                <td scope="row">An treatable infection caused by Trichomonas Vaginalis Parasite and contracted through sexual contact. Often shows no symptoms but causes a strong-smelling discharge, itching, and painful urination in women.</td>

                <td scope="row">A frequent bacterial infection in human's rectum, throat, or eyes, which occurs as a result of sexual contact with fluids. Symptoms are asymptomatic. Needs antibiotics to avoid having complications such as Infertility or Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).</td>

                <td scope="row">A skin condition caused by mites that infest the human skin by extensive skin-to-skin contact and sexual intercourse that shows extreme itching sensations as well as manifestation of an itching rash and mite burrows that infest into the human skin as it lays eggs.</td>

                <td scope="row">Caused by a bacterium referred to as the Spirochaete Treponema Pallidum and can only propagate via sexual routes. The manifestations are normally fourth-stage. Can attack all the organs in the body, and been referred as the "Great Imitator" because of the divergent signs and manifestations, including a painless sore referred to as a chancre. It can be easily treated.</td>
